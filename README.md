# Osticket-Ticket Lifecycle:Creation to Resolution
<p>
In this lab, I dived into the process of managing tickets. I initiated this by simulating different scenarios that would require assistance, guidance, or technical support. For instance, I created sample tickets to mirror common user queries like software issues, account access problems, and hardware problems.
